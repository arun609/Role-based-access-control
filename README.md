# Role-based-access-control
A Firebase-powered authentication and role-checking system built using Python and ipywidgets. The application allows administrators to create users, assign roles, and manage access permissions based on user roles. It features a simple GUI where users can log in, and their access to specific modules is determined dynamically by their assigned role.
